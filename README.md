# corona-dashboard
Analysis of COVID-19 data with visualizations that are shown in a WebApp.

The data is taken from the german Robert Koch Institute (RKI) [link](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/nCoV.html). 

## How to start
You can get a first impression of the data without using the WebApp. Clone the repository or just download the data folder and COVID-Analysis.ipynb. This jupyter notebook gives you a first overview over the data with some simple visualizations. If you don't know how to use jupyter notebook check out their website [here](https://jupyter.org/).

## How to start the WebApp
Clone the repo and type `python corona_dashboard.py` in your terminal. This will show some lines in the terminal. 
One of these lines will say something like: *Running on http://0.0.0.0:3001/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)*.
Click on the http adress or copy it into to you web browser to get the WebApp.
